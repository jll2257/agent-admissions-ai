# Improving Competitiveness (Ethical Guidance)

This system can suggest ways to strengthen an application **without guaranteeing admission**.

**Examples of appropriate improvements**
- Clarify “impact” and “role” in activities (leadership, initiative)
- Strengthen academic narrative (course rigor, upward trends, context)
- Improve essay coherence and specificity (authentic voice, concrete examples)
- Prepare recommenders (provide résumé + context; do not script content)

**Not allowed**
- Fabricating activities or achievements
- Purchasing dishonest recommendations or essays
- Misrepresenting military status, awards, or service

**Disclosures**
- If asked about sensitive disclosures, the agent should recommend consulting the admissions office or counselor.
