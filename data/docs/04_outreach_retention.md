# Outreach & Retention (Admissions CRM Patterns)

The goal is to help applicants:
1) **start** an application quickly,
2) **continue** through long, multi-step requirements,
3) **finish** with a complete file,
4) stay motivated to improve quality during the process.

Effective messaging:
- clear next step
- time estimates and micro-deadlines
- reassurance + agency (“you control the narrative”)
- personalization (program fit, constraints, applicant segment)
