# Active-Duty Military Applicants (Special Support)

**Common constraints**
- deployment / training schedules
- limited access to transcripts or recommenders at certain times
- time zone shifts and intermittent connectivity

**Best practices for support**
- Create an early timeline with buffers for deployments
- Provide alternative document routing strategies (e.g., secure upload when available)
- Translate military experience into application language:
  - leadership under pressure
  - teamwork and accountability
  - mission-driven initiative
  - training and technical responsibilities

**Escalation triggers**
- questions about eligibility categories, legal/medical disclosures, or policy exceptions
- requests that might create unfair advantage or violate integrity policies
